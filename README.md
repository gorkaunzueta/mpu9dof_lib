# Core Flight System : Framework : App : MPU9DOF Lib

This repository contains a library for an mpu9dof IMU (mpu9dof_lib), which is a framework component of the Core Flight System.

This library uses library bcm2835 for a Raspberry Pi so it can communicate with an IMU. 

In this library the different registers directions are stored so the values for accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer can easily be obtained.
